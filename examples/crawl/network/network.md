# Network Examples

## Introduction
Apart from IAM, one thing you will need in order to create your resources is a network.
This example aims to help with creating an independent network with the majority of the components available in OCI.

## Objectives
- Get familiar with the example
- Understand Thunder Network Module Components
- Create entire networks using Thunder Network


## Step 1 - Example & Module Details

The example is located in `thunder->examples->crawl->network`
The Network module is able to create vcns, subnets, internet gateways, nat gateways, security lists and network security groups, local peering gateways, dynamic routing gateways.

## Step 2 - Prepare the dependencies
Apart from the **provider.auto.tfvars**, there may be some other dependencies in the **terraform.tfvars** file that you will have to address.
All the dependencies from this section should have resources that already exist in OCI.

For this module, you are going to have dependencies to some external resources:
- compartments

In order to address those, you will need to change the values of the variables accordingly in the **terraform.tfvars** file.

Below, you will see the dependencies and what variables need to be changed.

#### Compartment Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **compartment\_ids**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the compartments that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1.."
}
```

## Step 3 - What are you going to get
The definition of each resource can be inspected in the **terraform.tfvars** file in the `thunder->examples->crawl->network` directory.

Don't forget to populate the **provider.auto.tfvars** with the details of your tenancy as specified in the [Lab 3 - Prerequisites Step 5](../../../workshop/index.html?lab=lab-3-install-prepare-prerequisites).


In the provided example, the following resources are created:
* 2 VCNS
  * hurricane 1
    * One Internet Gateway
    * One Nat Gateway
    * 2 Route tables (one with igw rule, the other with ngw rule)
    * One Security List
    * One NSG with INGRESS rules
    * 2 Subnets (one public, one private)

  * hurricane 2
    * One Internet Gateway
    * One Nat Gateway
    * 2 Route tables (one with igw rule, the other with ngw rule)
    * One Security List
    * One NSG with EGRESS rules
    * 2 Subnets (one public, one private)


In the example from below, there is a list of compartments containing 1 element. By setting in vcn_params `compartment_name` to sandbox, the network will be created in the first element of the list: `ocid1.compartment.oc1..`.
All variables can be extended in order to satisfy your needs.


The example is based on **terraform.tfvars** values.
Below there is a small part of the **terraform.tfvars** file, in order to be able to understand the linking between the resources.

```
compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1.."
}

vcn_params = {
  hur1 = {
    compartment_name  = "sandbox"
    display_name      = "hur1"
    vcn_cidr          = "10.0.0.0/16"
    dns_label         = "hur1"
  }
  hur2 = {
    compartment_name  = "sandbox"
    display_name      = "hur2"
    vcn_cidr          = "11.0.0.0/16"
    dns_label         = "hur2"
  }
}
```


## Step 4 - Running the code

Go to **thunder/examples/crawl/network**
```
# Run init to get terraform modules
$ terraform init

# Create the infrastructure
$ terraform apply --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars

# If you are done with this infrastructure, take it down
$ terraform destroy --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars
```

## Step 5 (Optional) - Experiment with the code
The number of the resources can be increased/decreased to suit any needs.
For example if you want to increase the number of subnets instances to 3 in the first VCN, you will have to modify the **subnet_params** variable in the terraform.tfvars file.


## Results
After you finish with this lab, you've created:
- 2 VCNS
- 4 subnets
- 2 nsgs
- 2 security lists
- 2 internet gateways
- 2 nat gateways
