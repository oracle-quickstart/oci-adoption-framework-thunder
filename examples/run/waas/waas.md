# WAAS

## Introduction
OCI WAF is a global security service that protects applications from malicious and unwanted internet traffic. WAF can protect any internet facing endpoint, providing consistent rule enforcement across a customer's applications.

WAF provides you with the ability to create and manage rules for internet threats including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection and other OWASP-defined vulnerabilities. Unwanted bots can be mitigated while tactically allowed desirable bots to enter. Access rules can limit based on geography or the signature of the request.

## Objectives
- Get familiar with the example
- Understand Thunder Waf Module
- Create a WAF using the module

## Step 2 - Prepare the dependencies
Apart from the **provider.auto.tfvars**, there may be some other dependencies in the **terraform.tfvars** file that you will have to address.
All the dependencies from this section should have resources that already exist in OCI.

For this module, you are going to have dependencies to some external resources:
- compartments
- load balancers

In order to address those, you will need to change the values of the variables accordingly in the **terraform.tfvars** file.

Below, you will see the dependencies and what variables need to be changed.

### Compartment Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **compartment\_ids**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the compartments that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1.."
}
```

### Load Balancer Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **uri**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ip of the load balancers that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
uri = {
  primary = "150.136.204.78" # Complete with the public ip address of the load balancer
}
```


## Step 3 - What are you going to get
The definition of each resource can be inspected in the **terraform.tfvars** file in the `thunder->examples->run->waas` directory.

Don't forget to populate the **provider.auto.tfvars** with the details of your tenancy as specified in the [Lab 3 - Prerequisites Step 5](../../../workshop/index.html?lab=lab-3-install-prepare-prerequisites).

In the provided example, the following resources are created:

1 WAF Policy with the rules:
  - Access Rules
  - Rate Limiting
  - Captcha Challenge
  - Device Fingerprinting Challenge
  - Human Interaction Challenge
  - JavaScript Challenge
  - Protection Rules
  - IP Whitelists

In the example from below, there is a list of compartments containing 1 elements and a list of uri containing 1 element. By setting in waas\_policy\_params `compartment_name` to sandbox, WAF will be created in the sandbox compartmanet `ocid1.compartment.oc1..`.
The same thing is happening to uri. You will need to associate the name of the uri with the public ip of the public load balancer.  
All lists can be extended in order to satisfy your needs.
After the creation of the policy, you should visit your DNS provider and add your CNAME to your domain's DNS configuration.

The example is based on terraform.tfvars values:

```

compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1.."
}

uri = {
  primary = "150.136.204.78" # Complete with the public ip address of the load balancer
}

cert_params = {}

        }
    }
}

```

## Step 4 - Running the code

Go to **thunder/examples/run/waas**
```
# Run init to get terraform modules
$ terraform init

# Create the infrastructure
$ terraform apply --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars

# If you are done with this infrastructure, take it down
$ terraform destroy --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars
```

## Results
After going through this lab and running the code, you should now be able to deploy a waf in OCI using Thunder.
