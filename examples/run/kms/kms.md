# KMS

## Introduction
OCI KMS (Key Management Service) provides centralized management of data encryption.

Encryption keys can be used for various services in OCI and can be of 2 types:
* Oracle-managed - without KMS, automatically handled by OCI
* Customer-managed - using KMS, you can handle it. Keys are stored in HSM (Hardware Security Modules) that meet FIPS 140-2 Level 3 security certification

KMS keys are customer-managed keys and can be of 3 types:
* wrapping keys - used when you need to wrap an external key material for import into Key Management. This is automatically created at vault creation. You cannot create, delete or rotate wrapping keys
* master encryption keys - can be generated or imported. This keys are stored in a vault and used when you need to associate a KMS key with a service (for ex: File Storage Service)
* data encryption keys - used to encrypt your data. It is itself encrypted with a master encryption key. For decryption purposes, the service (for ex: File Storage Service) store only the encrypted form of the data encryption key

## Objectives
- Get familiar with the example
- Understand Thunder KMS Module Components
- Create KMS in OCI using Thunder

## Step 1 - Example and Module details

You need to define 2 IAM policies:
* one to allow a user group to delegate access to keys
* one to allow services to use keys on behalf of those user groups

For example:
```
Allow service blockstorage, objectstorage-ap-mumbai-1, FssOc1Prod, oke to use keys in compartment MS
Allow group MS to use key-delegate in compartment MS
```

### Resource Details
The KMS module is used for creating vaults, keys and key versions. After that, the keys can be used for encrypting data on different resources / services:
* Instances boot volumes
* Instances block volumes
* File System Service
* Object Storage Service

* Vault parameters
    * compartment_name - The compartment name in which the vault will be created
    * display_name - The name of the vault
    * vault\_type - The vault type. Currently, 2 types are available: VIRTUAL (the DEFAULT value) and VIRTUAL\_PRIVATE

* Key parameters
    * compartment_name - The compartment name in which the key will be created
    * display_name - The name of the key
    * vault_name -  The vault name in which the key will be created
    * key\_shape\_algorithm - the encryption algorithm for which we can use the key. Currently, only AES can be used
    * key\_shape\_size\_in\_bytes - the size of the key exprimated in bytes. Currently, 3 values can be used:
    16 (for 128 bits), 24 (for 192 bits), 32 (for 256 bits)
    * rotation_version - whenever this number is increased, the key will be rotated. First value should be 0 in normal situations

To use a key with a specific resource / service (boot volume, block volume, File System Service, Object Storage Service) you just have to update the **kms\_key\_name** from the definition of that resource / service (instance\_params, bv\_params, win\_instance\_params, )


## Step 2 - What will you get
The definition of each resource can be inspected in the **terraform.tfvars** file in the `thunder->examples->run->kms` directory.

Don't forget to populate the **provider.auto.tfvars** with the details of your tenancy as specified in the [Lab 3 - Prerequisites Step 5](../../../workshop/index.html?lab=lab-3-install-prepare-prerequisites).
In the provided example, the following resources are created:

* 1 Linux Instance
    * it has 2 block volumes attached to it
    * the boot volume is encrypted using a kms key
    * 1 block volume is encrypted using a kms key
    * 1 block volume is encrypted using an Oracle-managed key (no KMS)

* 1 Windows Instance
    * it has 2 block volumes attached to it
    * the boot volume is encrypted using a kms key
    * 1 block volume is encrypted using a kms key
    * 1 block volume is encrypted using an Oracle-managed key (no KMS)

* 1 FSS (File System Service)
    * the file system is encrypted using a KMS key
    * it has 2 mount targets
    * export options can be set on mount targets

* 1 OSS (Object Storage Service)
    * it has a bucket definition
    * the bucket is encrypted using a KMS key

* 1 KMS vault
    * the type is the DEFAULT one which is also called VIRTUAL. The alternative is VIRTUAL_PRIVATE

* 3 KMS keys
    * they are located in the same vault
    * they have different shapes (AES-128, AES-192, AES-256) and can have multiple versions
    * they are used for encrypting different resources / services (boot volumes, block volumes, FSS, OSS)

## Step 3 - Running the code

Go to thunder->examples->run->kms
```
# Run init to get terraform modules
$ terraform init

# Create the infrastructure
$ terraform apply

# If you are done with this infrastructure, take it down
$ terraform destroy
```

## Known issues
In case you have keys with rotation_version greater than 0, you might get an error of this type while destroying KMS resources:
```
module.kms.oci_kms_key_version.this["key-hur1-2"]: Still destroying... [id=keys/ocid1.key..oc1, 2m0s elapsed]

Error: Service error:Conflict. The Key Version ocid1.keyversion.oc1.. cannot be deleted because it is the current key version of the key. http status code: 409. Opc request id: d092ca17c9e18fe0c615c0a95001e709/4EE72D8FB2C0786F51F54A141BE86CDD/5DBC1009AB87BC48CC3AD886EDD75778

```

To solve the issue:
* Go to the OCI console
* Find the keys which are having problems with destroying the key versions
* Rotate each key so that it has a new active version
* Then destroy again from Terraform
